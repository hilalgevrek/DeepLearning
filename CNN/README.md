# DeepLearning

CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network, which is a type of artificial neural network used in 
deep learning that is designed for processing and analyzing images and other grid-like data.

CNNs are designed to identify patterns and features in images by using a process called convolution. 
Convolution involves sliding a small filter or kernel over the input image and performing a dot product 
operation between the filter and the overlapping pixels of the image. This process generates a feature 
map that highlights specific patterns or features in the image.

CNNs typically consist of multiple convolutional layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers. 
The convolutional layers perform feature extraction and identify important patterns in the image, while 
the fully connected layers use these features to classify the image.

CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of computer vision tasks, such as image 
classification, object detection, and image segmentation. They are widely used in applications such as 
self-driving cars, facial recognition, and medical image analysis.
