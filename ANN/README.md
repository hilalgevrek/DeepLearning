# DeepLearning

ANN stands for Artificial Neural Network, which is a key component of deep learning. 
An artificial neural network is a mathematical model that is inspired by the structure 
and function of the biological neural networks in the human brain.

ANNs consist of interconnected nodes, called neurons, that process and transmit information. 
These neurons are organized into layers, with each layer performing a specific function. 
The first layer, called the input layer, receives the data to be processed. The middle layers, 
called hidden layers, perform complex computations on the data, and the final layer, called 
the output layer, produces the results of the computation.

ANNs are trained using a process called backpropagation, in which the network adjusts its weights 
and biases to minimize the difference between its output and the correct output. By iteratively 
adjusting these weights and biases, ANNs can learn to recognize patterns in the data and make 
predictions or classifications based on that data.

Deep learning models use ANNs with many layers to perform complex tasks such as image and speech 
recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. By using deep learning, ANNs can learn 
to represent and process increasingly complex patterns in the data, leading to better performance 
on a wide range of tasks.
