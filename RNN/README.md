# DeepLearning

RNN stands for Recurrent Neural Network, which is a type of artificial neural network used in deep learning 
that is designed to process sequential data.

RNNs are designed to work with input sequences that have a temporal or sequential relationship, such as 
time-series data or natural language text. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks that process 
data in a single pass, RNNs use a feedback loop that allows the output of the network to be fed back as 
input for the next step in the sequence.

This feedback loop allows RNNs to remember and utilize information from previous steps in the sequence when 
processing the current step. This makes them particularly useful for tasks such as language modeling, 
speech recognition, and machine translation.

One limitation of standard RNNs is that they can struggle with long-term dependencies, as the effect of 
information from earlier steps can decay over time. To address this issue, several advanced variants of 
RNNs have been developed, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, 
which are better at handling long-term dependencies by selectively retaining and forgetting information 
from earlier steps in the sequence.
