# DeepLearning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks 
to model and solve complex problems. It is a type of machine learning algorithm 
that involves training neural networks with a large set of data to make predictions 
or decisions based on that data.

Deep learning algorithms are characterized by their ability to learn and represent complex 
patterns in data by using multiple layers of artificial neural networks. These networks 
consist of interconnected nodes that process information and pass it to the next layer 
in the network.

Deep learning is used in a wide range of applications such as computer vision, natural language 
processing, speech recognition, and robotics. It has achieved remarkable success in tasks such as 
image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and playing games like chess and Go.
